                        <p>
                            Charitable nonprofits seeking 501(c)(3) tax exempt status should be aware of the IRS “27-month” rule.<span class="footnote" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The IRS publishes its tax-exempt organization procedures annually and sometimes tinkers with them during the year. The most recent version is <a href='https://www.irs.gov/irb/2017-01_IRB/ar11.html'>Proc. Rev 2017-5</a>."></span>
                            This rule is an IRS stopwatch that starts when a charitable nonprofit is “formed.” (More on "formed," below.)
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            <span class="plead">The rule.</span> Roughly speaking, the IRS gives a new 501(c)(3) 27 months from the end of the month that it was formed to submit the appropriate IRS form (usually 1023 or 1023-EZ) to be recognized as tax exempt.<span class="footnote" data-toggle="tooltip" title="There is of course more to the story, and more than (c)(3) organizations might be affected. See the <a href='#notes'>Notes</a>, below."></span>
                        </p><hr>

                            <span class="plead"> Example.</span> Suppose Charitable Doings, an Oregon nonprofit corporation, is formed on June 14, 2000. This charitable nonprofit wants both to be exempt from income tax and to accept donations that donors can deduct from <i>their</i> income taxes.<br><br>The 27-month clock automatically starts on June 30 (the end of that month). The rule requires the corporation to submit its application by the end of September 30, 2002&mdash;that’s 27 months after June 30:

                        <p>
                            If the deadline was met and the IRS recognizes tax exemption, then the donation received on July 30, 2000 will be a deductible donation&mdash;the donor can deduct it from their tax return. In addition, any income that the organization received during the pre-filing period is not taxable income.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Late filing has <span class="text-bold">two main consequences:</span> (1) The organization may owe taxes for for years that closed prior to the tax-exemption date (here the 2001 non-gift income), and (2) donations received before that date might not have been eligible for tax deductions (here the July 30, 2000 donation). <i>Donors might be unhappy if they took tax deductions for donations!</i>
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            The risk of disallowed deductions&mdash;after the donor has taken a deduction for them&mdash;highlights the importance of communicating to potential donors that an organization does not yet have a letter from the IRS officially <i>recognizing it as tax-exempt.</i> (You can always tell donors you have <i>applied</i> for exemption, but you do not want to tell them that you <i>are</i> exempt.) It’s up to the donor to risk a deduction if the nonprofit is not yet officially recognized as tax exempt. Most large donors will not make a donation without a recognition letter in hand.
                        </p><hr>
                        <p>
                            <span class="plead">MEETING the Deadline:  Two Options.</span> If you file on time, you must decide how to act while waiting for the IRS to respond. There are two options during the waiting period.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            <span class="plead">Assume the worst.</span> First, assume that you <i>are not</i> tax-exempt during the waiting period: (1) don’t accept donations or, alternatively,  accept donations but tell potential donors that they are not tax-deductible contributions; and (2) file ordinary tax returns (normally corporate tax returns, Form 1120) and pay any necessary taxes. If you later receive recognition of tax-exempt status from your formation date, you might be able to get a refund of those taxes.<span class="footnote" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Or so legend has it. I have not attempted this and the mechanics of securing a refund appear unclear."></span>
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            <span class="plead">Alternatively</span>, assume that you <i>are</i> tax-exempt: accept donations, telling donors that you have applied for tax-exempt recognition but you can’t guarantee it will come through, and decide whether or not to file a 990 tax-exempt income tax form. (I'll talk about that 990 in a future post.)
                        </p><hr>
                        <p>
                            <span class="plead">MISSING the Deadline:  Asking for An Extension of Time.</span> If you missed the 27-month deadline, charitable nonprofits filing Form 1023 can request that the IRS make exemption retroactive to the date of formation or an earlier date. This is done through an <span class="text-bold">extension of time request</span> on  Schedule E. The IRS states that “a request [for an extension of time] will be approved if the organization acted reasonably and in good faith, and granting relief will not prejudice the interests of the government. These standards are usually met if the organization files its application before the failure to file is discovered by the IRS.”<span class="footnote" data-toggle="tooltip" title="26 CFR &sect;&nbsp;301.9100-3."></span>
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Schedule E of the 1023 application notes that even if you did not meet the 27-month deadline for filing a 1023 application&mdash;and thus were not a 501(c)(3) from the date of organization&mdash;you can check a box and be considered a 501(c)(4) from your date of formation—another kind of tax-exempt nonprofit. A 501(c)(4), however, cannot receive tax-deductible donations. Donors might still be irate, but the nonprofit might avoid back taxes and penalties for late income tax.<span class="footnote" data-toggle="tooltip" title="26 CFR &sect;&nbsp;301.9100-3."></span>

                        </p><hr>
                        <p>
                            <span class="plead">When is the application “filed”?</span> Your application is filed when either a hard copy is postmarked or when the IRS receives it (if it's not mailed). If you electronically file the application, typically the submission date will be the filing date.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            <span class="plead">What about amendments or changes?</span> It is not uncommon for a 1023 application to require changes or amendments. In general, only minor changes&mdash;for example, fixing a clerical error&mdash;mean that the rules above still apply. But “[i]f the [IRS] requires the organization to alter its activities or make substantive amendments to its enabling instrument, the exemption will be effective as of the date specified in the determination letter.”<span class="footnote" data-toggle="tooltip" title="See Proc. Rev 2017-5 &sect;&nbsp;6.08.3(a)."></span>
                        </p><br>
                        <p>

                            <span class="plead">What does “formed” mean?</span> The IRS materials use both the terms “formed” or “organized” and occasionally "established."<span class="footnote" data-toggle="tooltip" title="<a href='https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf'>Publication 557</a> mentions &quot;organized&quot; on p.22 but the application itself says &quot;formed.&quot; There are other examples of loose usage."></span>
                            Since 1975 the IRS has taken the position that it means the date the state files a nonprofit corporation’s articles with the state.<span class="footnote" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Rev. Rul. 75-290, 1975-2 C.B. 215."></span>
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            <span class="plead">501(c)(4) special rule.</span> 501(c)(4) "social welfare" organizations should be aware of a new, additional timing rule&mdash;a strict 60-days-after-formation rule. I will discuss that in my next post.

                                Just about everyone&mdash;including the IRS&mdash;often says that the IRS “grants” tax exemption. Technically the IRS only either recognizes or refuses to recognize tax exemption. <i>Congress</i> grants tax-exemption through statutes.
                            </li><br>

                                The IRS technically provides <span class="text-bold">15 months</span> from formation for a 501(c)(3) to send in its  501(c) application.<span class="footnote" data-toggle="tooltip" title="26 CFR 1.508-1."></span> However, a special provision<span class="footnote" data-toggle="tooltip" title="26 CFR &sect;&nbsp;301.9100-1; see Rev. Proc. 92-85, 1992-2 C.B. 490."></span> provides an automatic 12-month extension, so it is effectively 27 months.

                                The Treasury Regulations establish a time limit for <i>charitable</i> nonprofits, as noted above. However, since 2013 the IRS has asserted that the 27-month rule applies to <i>most</i> nonprofits:

                                    &quot;(1) In general. A determination letter recognizing exemption of an organization described in &sect;&nbsp;501(c), other than &sect;&nbsp;501(c)(29), is usually effective as of the date of formation of an organization if: (1) its purposes and activities prior to the date of the determination letter have been consistent with the requirements for exemption; (2) it has not failed to file required Form 990 series returns or notices for three consecutive years; and (3) <i>it has filed an application for recognition of exemption within 27 months from the end of the month in which it was organized.</i>&quot; Proc.
